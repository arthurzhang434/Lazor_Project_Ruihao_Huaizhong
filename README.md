The file Lazor Project.py could solve the "Lazor" game following these steps:<b>
1) Read in the .bff file by changing the change the name of the file at the very end of the doce<b>
2) Run the code<b>

Most of the games (like tiny_5 and mad_1) will be solved correctly in a couple of seconds by our code.<b>
However, complex games (like mad_7) could be solved but it requires more time (a couple of minutes).<b>
