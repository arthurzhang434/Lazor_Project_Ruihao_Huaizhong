1. arrange A B C into the empty O site to generate 
a random distribution of the box.

2. Convert the box into the point with transmission/reflection 
condition with the coordnation.

3. put the laser ray in and generate all the point which the 
ray pass through.

4. Check that if all the expected point have a ray come through.


Type of variate: list of list

1. Box: 

   box[]

    (1) Center position (cx, cy): 
        (1,1) (3,1) (5,1) (7,1)
        (1,3) (3,3) (5,3) (7,3)

    (2) Box type: box_type: A/ B/ C/ o/ x
    x = no block allowed
    o = blocks allowed
    A = fixed reflect block
    B = fixed opaque block
    C = fixed refract block

    [(cx, cy), boxtype]

2. Grid Point:

    grid_point[]

    (1) Position: (gx, gy)

    (2) orientation (ox, oy): 
    up (0, -1) / down (0,1) / left (-1, 0) / right (1, 0)

    (3) type: o/ A/ B/ C
    o: pass the point
    A: reflect
    B: terminate the ray
    C: pass and reflect

  

3. Ray point:

    a for loop
    1. put the original input point in the in_rpoint[]


    incident ray point:
    in_rpoint[]

    (1) position (irx, iry)
    (2) direction(vx, vy) 

    [(irx, iry), (vx, vy)] 
    (same format as the given input laser)

    2. save the position of the input point in a list

    passpoint [(gx,gy)] 


    3. find all of the output point out_rpoint

    out_rpoint[]
    [(orx, ory), (vx, vy)]
    convert to next incident ray point

    next in_rpoint[]:
    irx = orx + vx
    iry = ory + vy

    4. convert to next incident point in_rpoint[]
    then start overt
